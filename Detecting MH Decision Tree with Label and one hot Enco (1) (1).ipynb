    "Importing required Libraries which is used in the project they are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. pandas (pd): The pandas library is used for data manipulation and analysis. It provides powerful data structures and tools to work with structured data. In this code, pandas is used to read the dataset from a CSV file, perform one-hot encoding to convert categorical variables, and handle missing values using the fillna() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. seaborn (sns): Seaborn is a statistical data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for creating attractive and informative statistical graphics. In this code, Seaborn is used to create a heatmap for visualizing correlations between features.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. matplotlib.pyplot (plt): matplotlib is a popular plotting library used to create varsklearn.metrics (accuracy_score, classification_report): ious types of visualizations in Python. The pyplot module provides an interface for creating plots, figures, and other graphical representations. In this code, it's used to create box plots and heatmaps for visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. sklearn.model_selection (train_test_split): The train_test_split function from Scikit-Learn is used to split the dataset into training and testing subsets. This separation helps in training the model on one subset and evaluating its performance on another, unseen subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. sklearn.ensemble (RandomForestClassifier): The RandomForestClassifier is a machine learning model from Scikit-Learn's ensemble module. It's used to build a Random Forest model, which is an ensemble of decision trees. The model is trained on the training data and used to make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. sklearn.metrics (accuracy_score, classification_report): The accuracy_score function is used to calculate the accuracy of the model's predictions. The classification_report function generates a detailed classification report, including precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each class. These metrics provide insights into the performance of the model."

    "Now, we're crafting three distinct sets of features, each possessing different levels of correlation with the target variable. This endeavor is undertaken to comprehend the impact of features on the efficiency of the model. By constructing these sets, we can systematically evaluate how individual attributes influence the model's predictive prowess and determine which combination yields the most accurate outcomes. This process enables us to uncover the significance of each feature, ultimately aiding in the optimization of the model's performance."
